      "overview": "A rip-roaring saga of runaway ambition stars Chicago’s own Simeon Henderson (“Chicago PD,” “Empire”) as Jeremy Brooks, an arrogant would-be news anchor in the grip of appetites that threaten to doom his most cherished relationships. An inveterate womanizer behind his long-suffering fiancée’s back, Brooks targets exactly the wrong alluring intern for an after-work dalliance, setting off a chain of fateful events that will burn bridges and mark his future. Director Miller brings a grand sense of melodrama to this story of broken faith, betrayed trust, and the quest for forgiveness.",

      "overview": "In 1979, Panorama reporter Tom Mangold led an investigation into the trial of Jeremy Thorpe and others for the alleged conspiracy to kill Thorpe's former lover, Norman Scott. Convinced that the former Liberal Party leader would be found guilty, a special post-trial programme was prepared. This was scrapped, however, when the jury returned its verdicts of not guilty for all defendants, and the programme has remained unseen for almost 40 years.  Edited and updated with new information about a fresh 2017 police inquiry into the case, Tom Mangold finally presents his story about how powerful political forces tried to protect Thorpe. The programme features revealing interviews from 1979 with Norman Scott, chief prosecution witness Peter Bessell and the alleged hitman Andrew 'Gino' Newton.",

Operation Chariot, as the raid was codenamed, had a simple aim – to destroy the dry dock and thus deny the German battleship Tirpitz a safe haven on the Atlantic coast of France. There were many who thought the mission too risky, but the Chief of Combined Operations, Louis Mountbatten, pushed forward. This programme explores the story around March 26th 1942, when Commandos in Cornwall boarded their floating bomb and set off to see if the element of surprise really could overcome all the odds.",

The best moments are those that find Clarkson sticking to the brief: interviewing the aristo-twit tobbogganeers of the Cresta Run; trying to understand why he, an experienced driver, will never be as fast as Michael Schumacher or Colin McRae; a musing on the qualities needed to be a fighter pilot; an examination of the extraordinary sport of speed-skiing, in which cat-suited kamikazes hit speeds of up to 150 miles an hour.",

The video was later released on DVD as part of The Jeremy Clarkson Collection in 2007. There was also a book written by Clarkson based on the series. Clarkson described the series as: \"From the sports cars of the wealthy in Monaco to the 1950s Morris Oxfords that still rule the roads in India, this is a lighthearted look at the culture of the car in 12 different countries. His travels include visits to Italy, home of the Ferrari - \"a steel deity, sex on wheels\"; Japan, where he has a brush with the local Mercedes-driving mafia; and Iceland, where he takes his life in his hands and hurtles around the most dangerous off-the-road course in the world in a customized 4WD jeep.\"",

      "overview": "The Jeremy Kyle Show is a British daytime television tabloid talk show presented by Jeremy Kyle. It has been broadcast on ITV since 4 July 2005. The show is produced by ITV Studios and is broadcast each weekday. The show first appeared as a replacement for Trisha Goddard's chat show, which was moved to Five.\n\nThe show is based on confrontations in which guests attempt to resolve issues with others that are significant in their lives, these issues include: family, relationship, sex, drug, alcohol and other issues. Frequently, guests display strong emotions such as anger and distress on the show, and Kyle is often harsh towards those that he feels have acted in morally dubious or irresponsible ways, whilst strongly emphasising the importance of traditional family values. This has led to both criticism and parody of the show in newspapers and on television, and even led to the show being described as \"human bear-baiting\" by a Manchester District Judge, during a prosecution after guests had been involved in a violent incident on the show.\n\nThe show's 1,000th episode was aired on Thursday 18 March 2010. In 2012, the show returned from their Christmas break with a new set.",
